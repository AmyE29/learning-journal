# Amy Evans' Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is the belief that anyone can learn and change their abilities with hard work and effort.
For me growth mindset is not being afraid to try new things, I can grow by trial and error.  I have not *yet* learned all the things that I am capable of learning.

## ***What keeps me in growth mindset***
1.  Not being afraid to try new things, like signing up for this course
2.  Failure is not an obstacle, it's a learning experience - If you don't fail you don't learn 
3.  Look to others for help and not feel threatened by them, its okay to not know the answers
4.  Putting in the effort even when I want to give up. To keep working, even when I don't want to
