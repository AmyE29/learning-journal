# Amy Evans' Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is the belief that anyone can learn and change their abiiities with hard work and effort.
For me growth mindset is not being afraid to try new things, I can grow by trial and error.

## ***What keeps me in growth mindset***
1. Not being afraid to try new things - Signing up for this course
2. Failure is not an obstacle, it's a learning experience - 
3. Look to others for help and not feel threatened by them
4. Putting in the effort even when I want to give up
