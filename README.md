# Amy Evans' Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is the belief that anyone can learn and change their abiiities with hard work and effort.
For me growth mindset is not being afraid to try new things, I can grow by trial and error.

## ***What keeps me in growth mindset***
- Not being afraid to try new things
- Failure is not an obstacle, it's a learning experience
- Look to others for help and not feel threatend by them
