# Programming with javascript

Javascipt allows you to:
- *Access* the content on the page
- *Modify* the content of the page
- *Program* rules or instructions that the browser can follow
- *React* to events triggered by the user or browser

## Javascript is a series of instructions a computer can follow step by step.
To write a script you should:
1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step 

Computers do tasks differently that humans, so your script my contain very specific instructions. 

### Expressions
Expresstions can be used to assign a value to a variable.
    
    var color = 'blue';

Or can use to or more values to return a single value.

    var area = 3 * 2;

### Operators
Expressions rely on **operators**, they let programmser create a single value from one or more values. Some types are
 - Assingment operators: assigns a value to a variable 
 - Arithmetic operators: preform basic math
 - String operators: combine two strings
 - Comparison operators: compare two values and return true/false
 - Logical operators: combine expresstion and return true/false

 ### Functions
 Functions let you group a statements together to preform one task. When you ask your function to preform a task it is called ***calling the function***.  Information that is given to a function to complete the task is called the ***parameters***. When the function gives you an output, it is called the ***return value***.

 To declare a funtion you:

    function functionName() {
        document.write ('Put some text here')
    }
