Learning Handlebars

Adding handelbars to your project requires you to add the following script to your HTML page

    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/2.0.0/handlebars.js"></script>
    
From there you create a template in your HTML page, this needs to be done in a <script> tag, with a special ID so your browser doesn't try to read it like a JavaScript file. In this you wrap your expressions in {{ }} double (or triple) curly braces.

    <script id = "my-template" type ="text/x-handlebars-template">
        {{name}}
        {{age}}
        {{gender}}
    </script>
    
Flexbox Flexbox is flexible in the way it lays things out - both horizontally and vertically You can specify whether you want the containers to show up left to right(or right to left) in a row,

    .container { 
      flex-direction: row (or row-reverse):
    }

or top to bottom(bottom to top) in a column.

    .container { 
      flex-direction: column (or column-reverse): 
    }

You can use it to fix your spacing: 

    .container { 
        justify-content:space-evenly
     } 

The biggest relief for me is being able to center vertically easily: 

    .container { 
        align-items: center
    }

Containers inside of containers can also be Flexboxes.
